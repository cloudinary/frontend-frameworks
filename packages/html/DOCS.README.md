# Welcome

## About this project

This is the home of our Javascript libraries. These libraries can be used to render the
Cloudinary images generated by @cloudinary/base. Our library also includes the following advanced functionality 
plugins

- accessibility
- lazyload
- placeholder  
- responsive

*NOTE:* Currently only our React SDK is available 

## Installation
```bash
npm install @cloudinary/base 
npm install @cloudinary/react
```

## Simple usage
```tsx

// Import the cloudinary class, and the plugins you want to use
// In this case, we import a cloudinary image type and accessibility and responsive.

import React, { Component } from 'react'
import {CloudinaryImage} from "@cloudinary/base/assets/CloudinaryImage";
import { CldImg, accessibility, responsive } from '@cloudinary/react';

 const App = () => {
  let img = new CloudinaryImage()
    .setConfig({
      cloud: {
        cloudName: 'demo'
      }})
    .setPublicID('sample');

  return (
    <div>
      <CldImg transformation={img} plugins={[responsive(), accessibility()]}/>
    </div>
  )
};
```

## Plugin Order

<div>
We recommended the following order when using our plugins to achieve the best results. 
<br/><br/>

``plugins={[lazyload(),responsive(), accessibility(), placeholder()]}``

Plugins can of course be omitted but the order from above should 
remain to ensure the best possible results.
