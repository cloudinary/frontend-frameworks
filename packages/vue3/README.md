## Usage Example
### Setup
```vue
<script type="module">
import { AdvancedImage, responsive } from "@cloudinary/vue3"
import { CloudinaryImage } from "@cloudinary/url-gen/assets/CloudinaryImage";

export default {
  components: {
    AdvancedImage
  },
  data() {
    return {
      plugins: [responsive({steps: 100})],
      cldImg: new CloudinaryImage(
          "sample",
          {cloudName: "demo"}
      )
    };
  }
};
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <p>text</p>
    <AdvancedImage :cldImg="cldImg" :plugins="plugins" />
  </div>
</template>```

### Generate Image elements
    - Use <AdvancedImage> to generate image tags

### Advanced Plugin Features
- [See full documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/react_integration#plugins)

We recommend the following order when using our plugins to achieve the best results:
```js
[lazyload(),responsive(), accessibility(), placeholder()]
```

You can omit any plugin, but the order from above should remain.

### File upload
This SDK does not provide file upload functionality, however there are [several methods of uploading from the client side](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/vue_image_and_video_upload).
