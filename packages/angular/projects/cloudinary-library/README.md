## Installation
### Install using your favorite package manager (yarn, npm)
```bash
npm i @cloudinary/url-gen @cloudinary/ng --save

```
Or
```bash
yarn add @cloudinary/url-gen @cloudinary/angular --save
```

## Usage
### Setup
```tsx
// In your app.module.ts:

// Import the CloudinaryModule.
import {CloudinaryModule} from '@cloudinary/ng';

imports: [
  ...,
  CloudinaryModule
],
```

### Transform and Optimize Assets
- [See full documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/angular_image_manipulation)

```tsx
import {CloudinaryImage} from '@cloudinary/url-gen/assets/CloudinaryImage';

export class AppComponent implements OnInit{
  img: CloudinaryImage;

  ngOnInit() {
     const myCld = new Cloudinary({ cloudName: 'demo'});
     this.img = myCld().image('sample');
  }
}
```

In your view add the component with your transformation
```html
<advanced-image [cldImg]="this.img"></advanced-image>
```

### Generate Image and Video HTML Tags
    - Use <advanced-image> to generate image tags
    - Use <advanced-video> to generate video tags

### Advanced Plugin Features
- [See full documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/angular_integration#plugins)
<br/><br/>
We recommend the following order when using our plugins to achieve the best results: 
<br/><br/>

```js
import { CloudinaryImage } from "@cloudinary/url-gen";
import {
  lazyload,
  responsive,
  accessibility,
  placeholder
} from "@cloudinary/ng";

export class AppComponent {
  cloudinaryImage = new CloudinaryImage("sample", { cloudName: "demo" });
  plugins = [lazyload(),responsive(), accessibility(), placeholder()];
}
```

```html
<advanced-image [cldImg]="cloudinaryImage" [plugins]="plugins">
```

You can omit any plugin, but the order from above should remain.

### File upload
This SDK does not provide file upload functionality, however there are [several methods of uploading from the client
 side](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/angular_image_and_video_upload).
